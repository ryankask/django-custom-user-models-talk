These slides are for a talk I am giving (or gave) on Monday, November
11, 2012 at the [London Django Users
meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-London-Django-Meetup-Group/events/89775692/)
about Django 1.5's customer user models.

Are you a Django coder or interested in Django? Come to our next
meeting! We have them every month at a centrally located pub in
London.
